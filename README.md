# Time-Syncronisation-Using-An-IoT-Device
Implementation of a time synchonisation network using the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) approach. I used three TI cc2650 sensortags (one acting as an rpl border router and the other 2 acting as nodes programmed with `udp-server.c`). The [rpl border-router code](https://github.com/iot-lab/contiki/tree/master/examples/ipv6/rpl-border-router) is programmed onto the other sensortag. `timesync.py` runs on the client side.
